Code submission format
This is a code execution challenge! Rather than submitting your predicted labels, you'll package everything needed to perform inference and submit a ZIP archive for containerized execution. The runtime repository contains the complete specification for the runtime and gives you tools for local testing.

All submissions for inference must run on Python 3.12. No other languages or versions of Python are supported. If you want to learn more about how our code execution competitions work, check out our blog post for a peek behind the scenes.

The general process for making a submission is:

Create a properly formatted submission.zip containing your model and code for performing inference
Debug and verify your submission works correctly by:
Testing your submission locally using Docker
Submitting as a smoke test to test against a small dataset, from the submissions page
Submit as a normal submission to predict on the full test set, also using the submissions page
Results of your submissions are tracked on the submissions page. You can track the execution status of your submissions here, view logs (note: log output is limited to 300 lines, with 300 characters per line), and track the score of your predictions. Errors that happen during scoring will also appear here.

What to submit
Your submission will be a ZIP archive (e.g., submission.zip). The root level of the submission.zip file must contain a main.py Python script which performs inference in the competition execution environment and writes your predictions to the required output file.

Here's an example of what a submission might look like. The only file that must exist in your submission.zip is main.py. Note that you should make sure that main.py is in the root layer of the archive. Be careful if you're trying to zip up a folder containing your main.py—this often causes it to be nested inside the folder.

submission.zip
├── main.py                 # Required: entrypoint script (executed by the evaluator)
├── my_module/
│   ├── preprocessing.py
│   ├── model.py
│   └── ...
└── my_model_weights.bin
To help develop and test your solution, we provide you with the runtime repository. You can find an example submission there.

What happens during execution
During code execution, your submission will be unzipped and run in our cloud compute cluster. The container will run your main.py script. The script will have access to the following directory structure:

/code_execution/
├── data/
│   ├── niftis/
│   │   └── ...                  # NIfTI imaging files for the test set
│   └── submission_format.csv
└── src/
│   └── ...your files are unzipped into here...
└── submission.csv - you should write your predictions here
The working directory will be /code_execution/. Your code will be unzipped into src/ and the test set DaT scans will be in the data/niftis/ subfolder. The data/ directory is read-only.

Output format
Your code must write a submission.csv file to the root folder containing one prediction per examination. The format must match the format of the submission_format.csv in the runtime exactly, with only two columns:

uid (str) — unique identifier for each DaT scan examination
is_pathologic (float) — your predicted probability that the examination is abnormal, as a value between 0.0 and 1.0
Predictions are scored with log loss (see the problem description), so submit calibrated probabilities rather than hard 0/1 labels.

For example, if your predictions for the first few examinations look like this:


uid	is_pathologic
xaji0y6d	0.04
pbhsahxt	0.12
hv3a3zmf	0.87
8mdd4v30	0.55
t9nt3w5u	0.98
Your submission.csv file would look like:

uid,is_pathologic
xaji0y6d,0.04
pbhsahxt,0.12
hv3a3zmf,0.87
8mdd4v30,0.55
t9nt3w5u,0.98
The submission should be written to submission.csv in the root folder of the working directory. You should use the submission_format.csv in the execution environment as a template for your submission, as illustrated in the examples in the runtime repo.

Testing your submission
The machines for executing your inference code are a shared resource across competitors, so please be conscientious in your use of them. Before you make a full submission, you should:

Test locally
Test in the limited smoke test environment
Once your submission runs successfully both locally and in the smoke test environment, make a full competition submission
Testing your submission locally
You should first and foremost test your submission locally using Docker. This is a great way to work out any bugs and ensure that your model performs inference successfully. See the runtime repository's README for further instructions.

Smoke tests
For additional debugging, we provide a "smoke test" environment that replicates the test inference runtime but runs only on a small set of examinations. In the smoke test environment, the test data structure is the same (niftis/ and submission_format.csv), but the available data represents a small sample drawn from the training set rather than the full test set. Smoke tests are not considered for prize evaluation and are intended to let you test your code for correctness and speed.

Submission checklist
Submission includes main.py in the root directory of the ZIP archive. There can be additional Python modules if needed—see example above.
Submission contains any model weights that need to be loaded. There will be no network access inside the runtime environment.
Submission does not print or log any information about the test dataset. Doing so may be grounds for disqualification based on the requirement that test samples are processed independently.
The main.py script loads the data for inference from the data/ subdirectory of the working directory. This directory is read-only.
The main.py script writes predictions to submission.csv in the root folder. The format of this file must match submission_format.csv exactly.
Please be aware that the machines for executing your code are a shared resource across competitors, so please be conscientious in your use of them. Thoroughly test your submissions locally, add progress information to your logs, and cancel jobs that will fail because you expect them to run into the time limit.

Runtime environment and constraints
Your code will be executed within a container whose image is defined in our runtime repository. The limits are as follows:

Your submission must be able to run using Python 3.12 and the Python dependencies defined in the runtime repository. You can see dependencies specified in the pyproject.toml and the uv.lock files.
The submission must complete execution in 3 hours or less. Smoke test submissions must complete in 6 minutes or less.
The container will have access to the following hardware:
A single NVIDIA A100 GPU with 80 GiB of GPU VRAM
24 vCPUs
The container has access to 24 vCPUs powered by an AMD EPYC™ 7V13 chip and 220GB RAM.
The container has 1 NVIDIA A100 GPU with 80GB VRAM. All of your code should run within the GPU environments in the container, even if actual computation happens on the CPU.
The container will not have network access. All necessary files (code and model assets) must be included in your submission.
The container will not have root access to the filesystem.
Logging display is limited to 300 lines and 300 characters in each line.
Requesting additional package installations to runtime
Since the container will not have network access, all packages must be pre-installed. The runtime is built using uv and PyTorch backed by CUDA 12.9. We are happy to add packages as long as they do not conflict and can build successfully. Python packages should be available via PyPI. To request an additional package be added to the runtime environment, follow the instructions in the runtime repository.

Happy building! Once again, if you have any questions or issues you can always head on over to the user forum!
